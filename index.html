<h2> Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. </h2>
     <p> students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, 
     a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.
     A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116).
   ength and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph.
